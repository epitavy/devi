To build the images, you should have one folder names `code` with every resources and another one
named `data` with the data (pdf etc). The root folder should follow this architecture:


├── build.sh
├── code
│   ├── back
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   ├── conanfile.txt
│   ├── resources
│   ├── server
│   ├── sources
│   └── thirdparty
├── data
│   └── directories
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile.step1
├── Dockerfile.step2
├── extract.sh
├── README
├── requirements.txt
8 directories, 9 files

Step 3.1
Then build the back-builder image and compile the code with:
```
docker-compose build back-builder
docker-compose up back-builder
```

Step 3.2:
Then build the app image and run the server with:
```
docker-compose build app
docker-compose up app
```
